## Introduction
In this project, we explore the trade-offs between using a concurrency-pattern pipeline and a sequential pattern for encrypting archives. Encryption is a critical process in securing data, and the choice of pattern can significantly impact performance, scalability, complexity, and error handling. This documentation provides a comprehensive analysis of both approaches, helping developers make informed decisions for their specific use cases.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates two different patterns for encrypting archive files:
1. **Concurrency-pattern Pipeline:** Uses multiple threads or processes to handle different stages of the encryption process concurrently.
2. **Sequential Pattern:** Processes each file in a linear, step-by-step manner.

The goal is to compare these patterns in terms of performance, scalability, complexity, and error handling.

## Concurrency-pattern Pipeline
The concurrency-pattern pipeline splits the encryption process into distinct stages, with each stage handled by a separate thread or process. This allows multiple files to be processed simultaneously, potentially improving throughput and efficiency.

### Advantages
- **Performance:** By parallelizing tasks, the pipeline can handle multiple files at once, reducing overall processing time.
- **Scalability:** Easily scales with additional hardware resources, allowing more files to be processed concurrently.

### Disadvantages
- **Complexity:** Requires careful management of threads and processes, increasing the complexity of the codebase.
- **Error Handling:** More challenging to implement robust error handling across multiple concurrent tasks.

## Sequential Pattern
The sequential pattern processes each file one after the other, ensuring that each step of the encryption process is completed before moving on to the next file.

### Advantages
- **Simplicity:** Easier to implement and understand, with straightforward control flow.
- **Error Handling:** Simplified error handling, as each file is processed independently.

### Disadvantages
- **Performance:** Can be slower, as files are processed one at a time, limiting throughput.
- **Scalability:** Less efficient with additional hardware resources, as it doesn't leverage parallel processing.

## Trade-offs

### Performance
- **Concurrency-pattern Pipeline:** Generally offers better performance by processing multiple files in parallel. Ideal for systems with multiple CPUs or cores.
- **Sequential Pattern:** Slower, as it processes files one at a time. Performance improvements are limited by the speed of individual file processing.

### Scalability
- **Concurrency-pattern Pipeline:** Highly scalable, benefiting from additional hardware resources. Can handle larger workloads more efficiently.
- **Sequential Pattern:** Limited scalability. Adding more resources doesn't significantly improve processing speed due to the linear nature of the pattern.

### Complexity
- **Concurrency-pattern Pipeline:** More complex to implement and maintain. Requires knowledge of concurrent programming and careful management of shared resources.
- **Sequential Pattern:** Simpler and easier to implement. Suitable for projects where simplicity and maintainability are more important than performance.

### Error Handling
- **Concurrency-pattern Pipeline:** Error handling is more complicated, as errors can occur in multiple concurrent tasks. Requires robust mechanisms to handle and recover from errors.
- **Sequential Pattern:** Simplified error handling. Errors can be caught and handled at each step, ensuring that one file's failure doesn't affect others.

## Conclusion
Choosing between a concurrency-pattern pipeline and a sequential pattern for encrypting archives depends on the specific needs of your project. If performance and scalability are critical, and you have the resources to manage complexity, the concurrency-pattern pipeline is a suitable choice. However, if simplicity and maintainability are more important, the sequential pattern may be more appropriate.
